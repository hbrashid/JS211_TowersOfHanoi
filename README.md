Towers of Hanoi - Code Plan:
Smaller piece can be placed onto larger piece

We need a way to accept input from the user (from stack to stack)
Then we validate the input (from < to) - we need to also report an error when you move a larger piece onto a smaller piece
Then we process the input (move the piece) by using push and pop
Then we check for winner
Then we return the result, if not a winner, we keep going
